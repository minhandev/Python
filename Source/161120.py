##Bieu thuc if
# x = 5 + 4
# if x==5:
#     print(x)
# else:
#     print("eroor")

##So sanh so thuc
# x = 1.11 - 1.10
# y = 2.11 - 2.10
# print('x', x , " ", "y", y )
# diff = x-y
# if diff < 0:
#     diff = - diff
# if diff < 0.0000001:
#     print("diff < 0.0000001:")
# else:
#     print("!=")

##Su dung if else nhu phep gan
# x = 2 
# y = 3
# if x != y:
#     c = 113
# else:
#     c = 115
# print(c)
